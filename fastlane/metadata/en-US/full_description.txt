LibreFind is a free and lightweight Android app that scans your device locally and queries our database to identify proprietary software and recommend Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) alternatives.

<b>Core Features</b>

• Scan installed apps to detect proprietary software
• Get FOSS alternative recommendations
• View sovereignty scores showing FOSS vs proprietary ratio
• Community-driven database

<b>Community Contributions</b>

• Propose new FOSS alternatives for review
• Submit pros and cons for existing alternatives
• Vote on app recommendations
• Help build a comprehensive alternative database

The app only queries the database for FOSS alternatives when proprietary apps are detected.
